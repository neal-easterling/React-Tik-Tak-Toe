# React-Tik-Tak-Toe

## Description
MIT xPro MERN stack assignment for using Reactjs.  Simple tik tak toe game to learn passing of data from parent to child in Reactjs.

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
- Stop game play once a winner is achieved.
  - Each button could be deactivated when a win state is detected.  Set the button element to disabled = true in a loop.
- Use a single line for next player and winner state.
  - Create a conditional statement to display "Next Play" until a win state is detected.  Once it is, it would display the "winner statement".
- Improve CSS stylings including Win State Shift
  - The juxtaposition of the colors of the board is very jarring to me.  Outline and base colors would be changed in the styles.css.  On win state detection, a class could be added to the board itself to create a shift of the whole board to the winning players colors.
